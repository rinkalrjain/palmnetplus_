# PalmNetPlus: Recognition-Oriented Palmprint Enhancement

PalmNetPlus is a deep learning-based palmprint enhancement framework designed
for low-light and noisy biometric acquisition scenarios. The architecture
combines multi-scale convolutional feature extraction with transformer-based
global context modeling.
